## CodeFlare Pipelines

CodeFlare Pipelines reimagined pipelines to provide a more intuitive API for the data scientist to create AI/ML pipelines, data workflows, pre-processing, post-processing tasks, and many more which can scale from a laptop to a cluster seamlessly.

See the API documentation [here](https://codeflare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/codeflare.pipelines.html), and reference use case documentation in the Examples section.

Examples are provided as execuatble [notebooks](https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare/tree/main/notebooks). 

Notebooks can can be run with locally with:
```shell
jupyter-lab notebooks/<example_notebook>
```

Or, if using any of the recommended cloud based deployments, examples are found in `codeflare/notebooks`, which can be executed directly from Jupyter environment. 

As a first example, we recommend the [sample pipeline](https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare/blob/main/notebooks/sample_pipeline.ipynb).
